# Analog-Clock
An analog clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and positioning the clock face and hands, and JavaScript to update the rotation of the hands based on the current time. It dynamically adjusts the hands every second to show accurate time.
